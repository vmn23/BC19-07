If you are not in pain, don't use ibuprofen pm, but instead try just Benadryl.his stuff works great for falling asleep, but the drawback is being very tired when I wake up. Not everyone has this issue, but I do. Getting out of bed is extra hard, since after 8 hours ibuprofen stops working, so your pain comes back, and you might still be sleep. Use with caution and don't replace ibuprofen with this!"

After few months I got another ulcer and again I needed this medication. I went to the pharmacy and I was told I needed another prescription. Unfortunately it takes me at least 3 hours to go and see the doctor just to get the same prescription she gave me before. I asked if there was something similar and there I found Chloraseptic Sore Throat Spray, Cherry, 6-Ounce (177 ml) (Pack of 3) I did not need prescription for this one and the result was way better than with my previous medication. It numbs your mouth, mainly where you spray and the pain goes away for a while. Very good for ulcers in the mouth."
